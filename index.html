            It's like you got superpowers <br>
            Turn my minutes into hours <br>
            You got more than 20/20, babe <br>
            Made of glass the way you see through me <br> 

        </p>
        <p>
            You know me better than I do <br>
            Can't seem to keep nothing from you <br>
            How you touch my soul from the outside <br>
            Permeate my ego and my pride
        
        </p>

            I wanna love me <br>
            The way that you love me <br>
            Ooh, for all of my pretty <br>
            And all of my ugly too <br> 
            I'd love to see me from your point of view <br>
        </p>

            It's you I'll always love <br>
            Forever only you I'll always love <br>
            Each time you say goodbye I'll always love <br>
            For the rest of my life <br>
            It's you I'll always love <br>

            Each song <br>
            I write will be <br>
            To say that you're <br>
            The one it's you I'll always love <br>
            For the rest of my days <br>

            And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime <br>
            And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine <br>
            For the love of my life <br>
            He's got glow on him face, a glorious look in him eyes <br>
            My angel of light <br>
        </p>

    <section class="image" id="img3">
        <p>
            I was all alone with the love of my life <br>
            He's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night <br>
            I don't need no light to see you <br>
        </p>    
        <p>
            Shine <br>
            It's your golden hour  <br>
            You slow down time <br>
            In your golden hour <br>
        </p>

    <section class="normal">
        <p>
            Cause all of the small things that you do <br>
            Are what remind me why I fell for you <br>
            And when we're apart and I'm missing you <br>
            I close my eyes and all I see is you <br>
            And the small things you do <br>
        </p>

            I just wanna see how beautiful you are <br>
            You know that I see it <br>
            I know you're a star <br>
            Where you go, I follow <br>
            No matter how far <br>
            If life is a movie <br>
            You're the best part <br>
            Just say you won't let go
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm so in love with you and I hope you know <br>
            Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold <br>
            We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown <br>
            And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old <br>
            Just say you won't let go <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yesterday is history <br>
            And tomorrow's a mystery <br>
            I can see you lookin' back at me <br>
            Keep your eyes on me <br>
            Baby, keep your eyes on me <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            'Cause I don't wanna lose you now <br>
            I'm lookin' right at the other half of me <br>
            The vacancy that sat in my heart <br>
            Is a space that now you hold <br>
            Show me how to fight for now <br>
            And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy <br>
            Comin' back into you once I figured it out <br>
            You were right here all along <br>
        </p>

            It's like you're my mirror <br>
            My mirror staring back at me <br>
            I couldn't get any bigger <br>
            With anyone else beside me <br>
            And now it's clear as this promise <br>
            That we're making two reflections into one <br>
            'Cause it's like you're my mirror <br>
            My mirror staring back at me <br>
            Staring back at me <br>
            You are the love of my life <br>
