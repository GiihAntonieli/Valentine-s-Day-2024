pov - Ariana Grande

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass the way you see through me

You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view


Eu Sei Que Vou Te Amar - Vinicius de Moraes

It's you I'll always love
Forever only you I'll always love
Each time you say goodbye I'll always love
For the rest of my life
It's you I'll always love

Each song
I write will be
To say that you're
The one it's you I'll always love
For the rest of my days


Dandelions - Ruth B.

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine


golden hour - JVKE

For the love of my life
He's got glow on him face, a glorious look in him eyes
My angel of light

I was all alone with the love of my life
He's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour 
You slow down time
In your golden hour


Those Eyes - New West

'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do


Best Part (feat. H.E.R.) - Daniel Caesar

I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go, I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
You're the best part


Say You Won't Let Go - James Arthur

Just say you won't let go

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go


Mirrors - Justin Timberlake

Yesterday is history
And tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
Staring back at me

You are the love of my life
